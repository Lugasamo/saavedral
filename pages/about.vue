        My name is Luis G Saavedra and I am a Melbourne-based User Experience designer, Digital Designer and Front-end Designer.  I have a huge passion for stylish design, clean implementation and product focus, with the user experience at the core of everything I do.<br><br>
        I bring diversity of thought and in depth knowledge to the teams I work with, and as an Industrial Designer, I always consider age, cultural identity and environment as part of my solution.<br><br>
        I use simplicity and practicality to express my ideas. From sketching, wire-framing and development of prototypes to final products, I work with passion and desire. I am always keen to learn new processes and ways of working, and help other to make project real and useful for humans.
